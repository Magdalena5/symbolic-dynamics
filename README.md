# symbolic-dynamics
This design includes methods such as Granger causality, Symbolic couplin trace and symbolic transfer entropy. Using the above methods, you can check whether there is causality between two signals and which signal is the cause.

It consists of files:

logistic_map: where you can generate data
granger: calculates Granger causality
SCT: symbolizes data using the symbolic coupling trace method
STE: symbolizes data using the symbolic transfer entropy method
Calculate_SCT and Calculate_STE: here you can load the data for calculating the values for the SCT and STE methods to check if there is a relationship between the two signals.
